Assignment: Number Guessing Game

Instructions:

Design a number guessing game using a while loop.
The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store it as the target number.
The user should be prompted to enter their guess.
Use a while loop to keep the game running until the user guesses the correct number.
Within the loop, check if the user's guess matches the target number.
If it matches, display a message congratulating the user and end the game.
If it does not match, provide feedback to the user (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low") and prompt for another guess.
Keep track of the number of attempts the user makes.
After the game ends, display the number of attempts it took for the user to guess the correct number.
Provide an option for the user to play again if they want to continue playing.
